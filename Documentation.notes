    Overview
-----------------------------------------------------------

The web app is an AI-powered platform that makes it easy for developers and non-developers to create custom APIs for their projects. Users can enter details of their desired API, and the app will generate the code. The app provides real-time error handling and automatic documentation generation for the generated API. Users can customize the API endpoints, parameters, and responses, and download the generated code and documentation for offline use. The generated code is optimized for performance and scalability.
